# Object_Detection_using_Single_Shot_Detector
Object Detection using SSD ! Why SSD? They're faster compared to CNN 

SSD - Single Shot Detector
  It's an algorithm that can be used to detect objects by dividing the image into grid and then looking for the object within the grid 
  SSD uses default boxes of different scales, shapes and aspect ratio on different output layers.
  These boxes help in locating the object within the grid .One interesting thing about SSD is it uses 8732 boxes 
  It's better used in scenario where the environment is often changing. Surveillance and self driving cars are examples

#Advantages & Disadvantages
  They're faster and dont require models That were trained on Huge chunks of dataset. Quick Detection.Faster.
  When SSD's are trained on Different ratios.They might miss out significant smaller or larger objects.Not accurate

#Please use the SSD model Caffemodel and prototxt as i have used in the notebook.
